    description:
      "Iron Pulse is a cinematic American rock project built on tension, release, and emotional truth. Fronted by dual lead vocalists, Elias Vale and Ari Solenne, whose voices collide and complement with grit and clarity, the band blends modern hard rock weight with melodic depth and atmospheric texture. Their sound moves between intimate confession and arena-level power, driven by layered guitars, grounded rhythm sections, and hooks that stay with you long after the last note fades.\n\nEach album is crafted as a full narrative arc, not just a collection of songs, exploring identity, resilience, memory, and the cost of becoming who you are. Iron Pulse is not nostalgia rock and it is not radio filler. It is deliberate, structured, emotionally charged music designed to feel lived in, not manufactured.",
