# Steel Motion Logo Instructions

To use your actual Steel Motion logo in the website:

1. Save your cropped Steel Motion logo image as:
   `public/images/steel-motion-logo.png`

2. The logo should be:
   - PNG format with transparent background
   - Approximately 200x200 pixels or similar square aspect ratio
   - High resolution for crisp display

3. Once saved, the navbar will automatically use the logo instead of the placeholder.

Current logo placeholder is using the exact colors from your provided logo:
- Background: #0F1E2C and #132B3A
- Glow: #00F2FF and #33CCFF
- Steel: #B3B3B3, #C0C0C0, #FFFFFF

The logo will be displayed at 40x40px in the navbar with proper hover effects and animations.
