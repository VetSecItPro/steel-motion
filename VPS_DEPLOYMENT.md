# Steel Motion Blog - VPS Deployment Guide

## üéØ Current Status

‚úÖ **Completed**:
- Blog implementation with Sanity CMS
- Local development and testing
- Code committed and pushed to GitHub
- All blog components and pages created
- Environment variables configured locally

## üöÄ VPS Deployment Steps

### Step 1: Connect to Your VPS

```bash
ssh -i ~/.ssh/steel_motion_vps root@72.60.115.247
```

### Step 2: Navigate to Project Directory

```bash
cd steel-motion
```

### Step 3: Pull Latest Code from GitHub

```bash
git pull origin main
```

### Step 4: Set Up Environment Variables

Create or update the `.env.local` file on the VPS:

```bash
nano .env.local
```

Add the following content (replace with your actual values):

```bash
# Resend API Key for email functionality
RESEND_API_KEY=your_resend_api_key_here

# Sanity Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=your_sanity_project_id
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_DATASET=production
SANITY_API_TOKEN=your_sanity_api_token_here
```

### Step 5: Install New Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

This will install the new Sanity dependencies:
- @sanity/client
- @sanity/image-url
- @portabletext/react
- next-sanity
- sanity
- groq
- styled-components

### Step 6: Build the Application

```bash
npm run build
```

**Note**: If the build fails with Turbopack, the package.json has been updated to use the standard Next.js compiler which works with Sanity.

### Step 7: Restart PM2 Process

```bash
pm2 restart steel-motion-app
```

Or if PM2 isn't running:

```bash
pm2 start npm --name "steel-motion-app" -- start
```

### Step 8: Check PM2 Status

```bash
pm2 status
pm2 logs steel-motion-app
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Build Fails

1. **Clear Next.js cache**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf .next
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Check Node.js version**:
   ```bash
   node --version
   # Should be 18 or higher
   ```

3. **Install dependencies again**:
   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

### If Blog Pages Don't Load

1. **Check environment variables**:
   ```bash
   cat .env.local
   ```

2. **Verify Sanity connection**:
   - Test the Studio at: `https://steelmotionllc.com/studio`
   - Check if the project ID and token are correct

3. **Check application logs**:
   ```bash
   pm2 logs steel-motion-app
   ```
